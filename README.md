## Introduction

This repository showcases a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. The project demonstrates how to create a basic API to perform database operations, including creating new records, fetching existing records, updating records, and deleting records.

## What I Learned

- How to set up a Node.js and Express server to handle API requests.
