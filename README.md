# Simple CRUD Operation with Node.js, Express, EJS, and MySQL

## Introduction

This repository showcases a simple CRUD Operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built using Node.js, Express, EJS, and MySQL. The project demonstrates how to create a basic API to perform database operations, including creating new records, fetching existing records, updating records, and deleting records.

## What I Learned

- How to set up a Node.js EJS, and Express server to handle API requests.
- Integrating MySQL as the database to store and manage data.
- Implementing CRUD operations to interact with the database.
- Testing the API endpoints using Postman to ensure proper functionality and data retrieval.
